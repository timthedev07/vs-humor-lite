# vs-humor-lite

A lite browser of the `r/ProgrammerHumor` subreddit, built for in-vscode procrastination.

The only thing it does is fetching the latest memes from the subreddit, that's it! This is why it's called vs-humor-**lite**. I personally find this convenient as you don't have to open your browser and go to the subreddit manually.

If any more functionalities are requested, I'll try my best to implement them!
